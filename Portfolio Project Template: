Project Overview
Briefly describe the project’s focus and purpose.

What problem or skill did you tackle?

Why is it important in cybersecurity/system administration?

Example: Audited, managed, and secured Linux file and directory permissions to enforce least‑privilege access and maintain compliance.

🛠️ Technical Execution
Break down the steps and commands you used.

1. Core Commands
ls -la → Audited permissions, including hidden files.

chmod → Modified read/write/execute rights.

chown / chgrp → Adjusted ownership and group access.

2. Security Practices
Restricted sensitive files to administrators.

Set executable permissions for scripts while preventing unauthorized edits.

Documented changes using permission strings (e.g., -rw-r--r--, drwxr-xr-x).

3. Specialized Scenarios
Hidden files: Secured .secret.txt with least‑privilege access.

Directories: Restricted unauthorized access with chmod.

Logs/scripts: Applied permissions to enforce accountability.

🔎 Practical Scenarios
Show how your work applies to real‑world use cases.

Secured log files for administrators.

Protected sensitive configurations in hidden files.

Enforced accountability by adjusting ownership.

✅ Results & Impact
Highlight the measurable or practical outcomes.

Strengthened system integrity by restricting unauthorized access.

Ensured compliance through documented permission changes.

Reinforced accountability with proper ownership and group assignments.

Verified updates by re‑running permission checks.
Example: Before & After Permissions: # Before
-rw-rw-rw-  1 user user  1024 Nov 29 09:00 log.txt

# After (restricted to admins)
-rw-r-----  1 root admin 1024 Nov 29 09:05 log.txt
